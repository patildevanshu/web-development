<h2>1. Explain what a pivot table is and how it is used in data analysis</h2>
<p>Ans.<b> A pivot table</b> is a table of values which are aggregations of groups of individual values of a more
    extensive table (such as from a database, spreadsheet, or business intelligence program within one or more discrete
    categories.<br> The aggregations or summaries on the groups of the individual terms might include sums, averages,
    counts, or other statistics. A pivot table is an outcome of statistically processing on a tabularized raw data and
    can be used for decision making. Pivot tables are one of Excel's most powerful features. A pivot table allows we to
